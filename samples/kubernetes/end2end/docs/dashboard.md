## What's on the WebLogic Server Dashboard
### Overview
The WebLogic Server Grafana dashboard provides a visualization of WebLogic Server runtime metrics allowing you to monitor and diagnose the runtime deployment of WebLogic Server.

At the top, left-hand corner of the dashboard page, there are filters for filtering out metrics based on specific domains, clusters, and servers. Another filter is `Top N`, whose candidate values are 3, 5, 7, and 10. The value will be applied to panels to show only the top N elements, thus avoiding too many elements being displayed.  

The WebLogic Server dashboard has four rows: `Servers`, `Web Applications`, `Data Sources` and `JMS Services`. Each row can be collapsed and expanded.
